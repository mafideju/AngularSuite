    <h3>First Great Quintet - 1955/1957</h3>
    <p>
      In the first half of 1955 Miles Davis was in a much better shape than he was in a long time.
      After kicking his heroin habit at his father’s house in 1953, he came back to New York City
      a more complete musician. His tone on the trumpet improved and so his ability to lead groups
      of musicians at recording sessions and in clubs. The quality of his 1954 studio output for
      Prestige exceeded most of his early 1950s recordings and yielded some of the best records
      in his career thus far: Walkin’, Bag’s Groove and Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants.
      He was ready to move on to the next stage of his career, gain wider recognition and prestige
       than what his current label (Prestige, ironically) could give him and no less important –
       make more money. Two factors in his professional life were lacking and prevented
       him from reaching his goals – a bigger, nationwide record label, and a stable working
       band of excellent musicians. But starting in June 1955 events started unfolding at an
       accelerated pace for Miles. This is the story of his first classic quintet and the
       recordings they made in 1955 and 1956, including some of the most revered albums in jazz
       history.

      Miles Davis was more than a trumpet player, composer and taste-maker—he led some of the
      greatest bands in the history of jazz. The main musicians from his first great
      quintet was John Coltrane on tenor, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and
      Philly Joe Jones on drums.

    <h3>Second Great Quintet - 1965/1968</h3>
    <p>
      Miles Davis second great quintet -- Wayne Shorter on saxophone, Herbie Hancock on piano,
      Ron Carter on bass and Tony Williams on drums -- left behind four of the more perfect albums
      in acoustic jazz history. The records -- ''Miles Smiles,'' ''E.S.P,'' ''Sorcerer''
      and ''Nefertiti'' -- brought jazz to an extraordinary level of interaction, changing the
      parameters for group improvisation. Then in 1967, everything changed: Davis
      and the group started playing with electric instruments and pop textures, and the albums
      receded into history, albeit beautiful history.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time, the achievements of these four albums were overshadowed by music that
      was more extreme. The music of John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and even Davis's own
      subsequent electric music grabbed more attention. There was little indication that the
      four quintet albums would become some of the most influential recordings in jazz.
      But they are now acknowledged as masterpieces, the paradigm for the great jazz revolution
      of the 1980's led by the Marsalis brothers. And for completely different reasons,
      they have become extremely influential with young jazz musicians in the 90's as well.
      The albums have just been repackaged and reissued by Columbia Records as the six-CD
      boxed set ''Miles Davis Quintet, 1965-68.'' The set is the third installment in
      a series devoted to the music of Davis (who died in 1991), with at least seven planned.
      Future boxes, for example, include a three-CD set given over to a single album,
      ''In Silent Way.'' The series is one of the most ambitious reissue programs in jazz.
